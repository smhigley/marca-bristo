    <h1>The Disability Integration Act</h1>

    <h2>Why we are doing this</h2>
    
    <p>Last weekend Marca Bristo died. She was an icon in disability rights activism, a powerhouse, and a legend. She wrote parts of the Americans with Disabilities Act in the 90s, and has been an asset to both Republican and Democrat administrations. Up to her death, she was advocating for change:</p>

    <div class="blockquote"><blockquote>Ever the advocate, in the days before her death, Ms. Bristo received a phone call from Ms. Pelosi. According to her husband, the Speaker wished her well and said “I wish there was something I could do,” to which Ms. Bristo quickly replied: “You can. Move the Disability Integration Act to committee and to a floor vote.”</blockquote>

    <p>We must honor her legacy by calling Congress and urging them to pass the Disability Integration Act:</p>

    <p>The following scripts are a template for talking to your representatives about the Disability Integration Act. Feel free to personalize them with your own experiences and stories.</p>

    <h2>Senate Script</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is [Name], and I live in [City].</p>

    <p>I’m calling to ask [Representative Name] to support the Disability Integration Act, and to prioritize bringing Senate Bill 117 to the floor in honor of Marca Bristo.</p>

    <p>Seventeen years ago the Supreme Court upheld the right of people with disabilities to live within their communities whenever possible. But despite that decision and 30 years of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the lack of practical access to community services means segregation based on disability continues today. The Disability Integration Act is necessary to empower people with disabilities to live and participate in their own communities, and fulfill the promise made by the Court.</p>

    <p>Just days before she died, Marca continued to advocate for the Disability Integration Act. Please honor her life and her incredible legacy of disability rights advocacy by passing S.117.</p>

    <p>Thank you for your time.</p>

    <h2>House Script:</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is [Name], and I live in [City].</p>

    <p>I’m calling to ask [Representative Name] to encourage Speaker Pelosi to bring House Resolution 555 to the floor in honor of Marca Bristo.</p>
